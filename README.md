## SQL
This is my SQL portfolio where you can find the following folders:

1. [homework_1](https://github.com/ida-que/SQL/tree/main/homework_1)
2. [homework_2]()
3. [homework_3]()
4. [Theory - cheat sheet]()

Each homework folder contains:
1. An SQL file
2. A README.md file with steps descriptions. </br>

### Short descriptions of each folder:
* **homework_1** mostly contains CREATE operations.
* **homework_2** mostly contains SELECT operations.
* **homework_3** mostly contains JOIN operations.

The database administration tool which I use here is pgAdmin, and the DBMS is postgreSQL.
